        "explanation": "Code segment I correctly calculates baseArea as pi * r * r, then correctly calculates volume by multiplying baseArea by h. Code segment II calculates the base area of the cylinder and temporarily stores it in volume. This value is multiplied by h, resulting in the correct volume. Code segment III correctly calculates the volume by multiplying pi * r * r * h in a single expression."

        "correctAnswer": "B",
        "explanation": "The correct answer is II only. In statement I, the value of top is -10, the value of bottom is 10, the integer division -10 / 10 evaluates to -1, and the code segment does not cause any errors or exceptions. Statement II throws an ArithmeticException error because the value of top is 20 and the value of bottom is 0, which leads to integer division by 0."

        "correctAnswer": "D",
        "explanation": "Expression I evaluates to 0 since 2 / 5 evaluates to 0 and 0 % 3 also evaluates to 0. Expression II evaluates to 1 since 5 % 3 evaluates to 2 and 2 / 2 evaluates to 1. Expression III evaluates to 1 since 2 / 5 evaluates to 0 and 0 + 1 evaluates to 1."
